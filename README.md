I have some problems when start [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net) for Windows from Wine. I have problems with 
other alternatives for Gnu/Linux too. Only Cli from [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net) worked fine but process 
of using it a harder then just GUI apps. So, I decided write wrapper of Hamachi Cli.

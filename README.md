### Why it is exist?
I have some problems when start [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net). I have problems with other alternatives for Gnu/Linux too. Only Cli from [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net) worked fine but process of using it a harder then just GUI apps. So, I decided write wrapper of Hamachi Cli.

### How to use it?
Work in progress
